# FifteenPuzzleSolver (N-Puzzle Solver)
This Repository contains the solver for fifteen-puzzle To be specific, the NxN sliding puzzle solver in JAVA. The program uses a specific version of Kruskal Algorithm  mainly known by A* algorithm with three different heuristics. It uses greedy version of the A* algorithm along side of different heuristics in order to achieve faster solutions. 

Note that this does not focus on the optimality rather it focuses on more cases solved.
