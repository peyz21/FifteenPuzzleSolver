# FifteenPuzzleSolver (N-Puzzle Solver)
This Repository contains a experimental solver for fifteen-puzzle To be specific, the NxN sliding puzzle solver in JAVA. The program uses a specific version of Kruskal Algorithm  mainly known by A* algorithm with 3 different heuristics to obtain the result. It uses Greedy version of the A* algorithm ( also known as Pure-Heurisitc) along side of different a combination of heuristics in order to achieve a realtively fast solution for a given board (aproxiamtely less than 30 seconds). 

Note that this does not focus on the optimality rather it focuses on more cases solved.


How Does it work : 

Step 1 : after downloading Move to the src/fifteenpuzzle/Solver.java
